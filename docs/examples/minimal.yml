# Minimal Configuration
#
# All fields are optional. This file uses all defaults.
# Equivalent to having no gitsemver.yml at all.
#
# Defaults applied:
#   mode: ContinuousDelivery
#   tag-prefix: '[vV]'
#   commit-message-convention: both
#   base-version: 0.1.0
#   increment: Inherit
#   continuous-delivery-fallback-tag: ci
#
# Default branch configs (main, develop, release, feature, hotfix,
# pull-request, support, unknown) are all applied automatically.
#
# You only need a gitsemver.yml when you want to override defaults.

# Empty — all defaults apply
